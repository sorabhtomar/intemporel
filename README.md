Intemporel
===

Intemporel is a responsive WordPress theme. I'm trying to develop a classic theme with clean layout and standard typography. It has colors inspired from material design. Intemporel is a responsive WordPress theme for blogs and magazines. It's based on `_s` framework by Automattic.

* Well-commented HTML5 templates.
* Custom template tags in `inc/template-tags.php`.
* Extra functions `inc/extras.php` like fonts.
* A script at `js/header.js` that makes your menu a toggled dropdown on and adds search. It's enqueued in `functions.php`.

Installation
---------------

The theme is in development stage and many more changes are in the way. To install the theme, like other WordPress themes:

* Download theme from GitHub `Download Zip`, as I've not yet uploaded it on WordPress repository.
* Extract the folder `intemporel` in `wp-content/themes` directory of your WordPress installation.
* Activate it from Admin Dashboard.

Documentation
---------------

I'm working on the website to document all my code.
